## This repository uses LLM wiki memory

Malan keeps a persistent, LLM-maintained knowledge base under `wiki/Malan.wiki/` (a separate git repo), following the [llm-wiki pattern](https://github.com/tobi/llm-wiki). It is the project's durable memory: findings, decisions, experiment results, and intermediate insights belong in the wiki and accumulate over time. Three operations, **Query** (read it), **Ingest** (write to it), and **Lint** (health-check it), are codified in `wiki/Malan.wiki/SCHEMA_Malan.md`, in the `.claude/rules/` files, and in the `.claude/skills/` skills (`/wiki-source`, `/wiki-experiment`, `/wiki-lint`).

See also [llm-wiki.md](llm-wiki.md) in this repo for the underlying pattern.

## Quick start for collaborators

New to Malan? Clone the project repo, clone the wiki as a sibling sub-repo, then seed your local Claude Code memory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MahajabinMostafa11/Malan.git
cd Malan
[ -d wiki/Malan.wiki ] || \
    git clone https://github.com/MahajabinMostafa11/Malan.wiki.git wiki/Malan.wiki
./wiki/agents/claude-code/setup.sh --seed-memory
```

The wiki clone is guarded with `[ -d … ] ||` because the Claude Code overlay's `SessionStart` hook (`ensure-wiki.py`, installed by `setup.sh --hook`) auto-clones the wiki on first session start. If you opened Claude Code before running these commands, the wiki is already in place and the inner `git clone` is a no-op; teammates on other agents (or no agent) still get the clone as before.

After this, open Claude Code inside the repo. It will automatically pick up the project's slash commands (`/wiki-source` to ingest an external document, `/wiki-experiment` to file experiment results, `/wiki-lint` to health-check the wiki) along with the read/write/commit conventions in `.claude/rules/`.

The wiki at `wiki/Malan.wiki/` is a separate git repo with its own history and its own remote. After any wiki edit, commit in the wiki repo (not the project repo):

```bash
git -C wiki/Malan.wiki add <files>
git -C wiki/Malan.wiki commit -m "..."
```

Push the wiki only when you intend to publish the changes:

```bash
git -C wiki/Malan.wiki push origin master
```

## About the template

This project was instantiated from [crcresearch/llm-wiki-memory-template](https://github.com/crcresearch/llm-wiki-memory-template). Maintainers who need to pull template updates, add a new agent overlay (Cursor, OpenCode, etc.), or understand the instantiate/update scripts should read the template repo's documentation.
